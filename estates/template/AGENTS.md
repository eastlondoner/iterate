You must read README.md and iterate.config.ts files before you do anything in this repo. Check if there is a CONTRIBUTING.md present and if so, read it as well before making any changes.

- for template strings and dedent blocks, avoid raw backticks inside; use normal ' or " quotes whenever possible inside template strings, otherwise use \` to escape backticks
- Check package.json for available lint, typecheck, format, build and similar commands. Ensure that all such commands are passing when making code changes.
- keep diffs minimal; no refactors unless asked explicitly
